In Python, I find while loops very interesting and useful. I think they're interesting because they're able to repeat the code you give it. I find them useful because they save me time of typing out more code.

# September 17, 2024
This is a free week.

Following instructions exactly as given is important in coding because it can cause logic errors. If you dont follow intructions exactly as given, it can lead to your codes meaning something else entirely or it just not working in the first place. This shows how following intructions exactly as given is important because it can lead to logic errors which can lead to your code not working or meaning something else.

A process in which computer science plays a role in my daily activities are video games. Video games are literally made out of code which means without code, there would be no video games. Coding in video games are used to make assets, functions, graphics, and alot more. Without coding my life would be alot more boring because in my freetime I usually play video games.
