In Python, I find while loops very interesting and useful. I think they're interesting because they're able to repeat the code you give it. I find them useful because they save me time of typing out more code.

I think you could've specified for us to make our journal public and emphasized that we only had to do one per week. I did not encounter any challenges while following instructions.
# September 17, 2024
This is a free week.

Following instructions exactly as given is important in coding because it can cause logic errors. If you dont follow intructions exactly as given, it can lead to your codes meaning something else entirely or it just not working in the first place. This shows how following intructions exactly as given is important because it can lead to logic errors which can lead to your code not working or meaning something else.

A process in which computer science plays a role in my daily activities are video games. Video games are literally made out of code which means without code, there would be no video games. Coding in video games are used to make assets, functions, graphics, and alot more. Without coding my life would be alot more boring because in my freetime I usually play video games.

A computer science career that interests me is being a gameplay engineer. Gameplay engineers work with game engines and programming software to drive the game along with Programmer teams. They also work with animation and computer graphics software and write code to ensure the game can be brought to life. Some languages that are required are C, C++, Java, Nuke, and Unreal Engine. You need at least a bachelor's degree to be qualified for being a gameplay engineer. Opportunities for growth are progressing to Gameplay Programmer, Tools Programmer, or Engine Programmer. It aligns with my interests and goal in CS because that's basically what I want to be, I want to create games and being a gameplay engineer is exactly that, making the idea into a reality. Colleges that provide education for this career are Southern Methodist University, University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Dallas, and Baylor University.

Coding can be useful in other jobs because the problem-solving skills can make you try to view a problem from a different angle. Coding can be useful in other jobs like healthcare because you can code something to help figure out the health of a patient. In finace it can calculate income, profit, etc. Finally, in education it can encourage creativity.

AI can be helpful because they can save time, like if you're coding something tedious that you know how to code, you can save time by asking AI to code it for you. AI also doesn't have any bias, which means you could ask a controversial quetion and it will provide both pros and cons without an opinion. Finally, AI can automate repetitive tasks so you don't have to keep repeating doing a task, even if it's complicated. AI can be harmful because they can cause human job loss, which can cause peopel to have depression, anger, and not have a source of income. AI also lack creativity, this is because AI is dependant on programmed algorithms. Finally, AI can be hard to implement, they can be very costly, lack of essentials for the AI, and the lack of people experienced to implement it.

One way I think technology impacts the election positively because it can speed up the voting process and one way I think it could face some challenges is not inputting the correct option that a voter chose, this has been a problem in the past with technology with elections.

1. It's important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online because it can reveal things you don't want to be known about you. 2. You can use strong, unique passwords. 3. No, I haven't, but I hvae shared some embarrassing things as a child and now I would think before I post anything. 4. I can balance being open and collaborative in online spaces by limiting the amount of personal information shared online.

(This is without bias and just using sources.) A current event is the presidential election. In the election, Donald Trump won. This can lead to problem solving of agenda management and either the rise or decline of certain things. Advancements in computer science could play a role in this by having computers predict how things are going to turn out and how to optimize agendas. They can predict how things are going to turn out by creating a data sheet a computer can go off of to make a preciction. Then they can optimize agendas by being given what is optimized and what's not, then creating a code to make anything optimized.

Project Proposal and Setup: My idea is to make a unit converter, being able to convert kg. to g., ft. to in., kilometers to miles, etc. Some key features would be conversion calculation, supported units and categories, a interface to select different units, error handling, and a clear button. Some python concepts I'll be using are variables, dictionaries, functions, lists, conditionals, and loops.
