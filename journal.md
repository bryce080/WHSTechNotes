In Python, I find while loops very interesting and useful. I think they're interesting because they're able to repeat the code you give it. I find them useful because they save me time of typing out more code.

I think you could've specified for us to make our journal public and emphasized that we only had to do one per week. I did not encounter any challenges while following instructions.
# September 17, 2024
This is a free week.

Following instructions exactly as given is important in coding because it can cause logic errors. If you dont follow intructions exactly as given, it can lead to your codes meaning something else entirely or it just not working in the first place. This shows how following intructions exactly as given is important because it can lead to logic errors which can lead to your code not working or meaning something else.

A process in which computer science plays a role in my daily activities are video games. Video games are literally made out of code which means without code, there would be no video games. Coding in video games are used to make assets, functions, graphics, and alot more. Without coding my life would be alot more boring because in my freetime I usually play video games.

A computer science career that interests me is being a gameplay engineer. Gameplay engineers work with game engines and programming software to drive the game along with Programmer teams. They also work with animation and computer graphics software and write code to ensure the game can be brought to life. Some languages that are required are C, C++, Java, Nuke, and Unreal Engine. You need at least a bachelor's degree to be qualified for being a gameplay engineer. Opportunities for growth are progressing to Gameplay Programmer, Tools Programmer, or Engine Programmer. It aligns with my interests and goal in CS because that's basically what I want to be, I want to create games and being a gameplay engineer is exactly that, making the idea into a reality. Colleges that provide education for this career are Southern Methodist University, University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Dallas, and Baylor University.

Coding can be useful in other jobs because the problem-solving skills can make you try to view a problem from a different angle. Coding can be useful in other jobs like healthcare because you can code something to help figure out the health of a patient. In finace it can calculate income, profit, etc. Finally, in education it can encourage creativity.

AI can be helpful because they can save time, like if you're coding something tedious that you know how to code, you can save time by asking AI to code it for you. AI also doesn't have any bias, which means you could ask a controversial quetion and it will provide both pros and cons without an opinion. Finally, AI can automate repetitive tasks so you don't have to keep repeating doing a task, even if it's complicated. AI can be harmful because they can cause human job loss, which can cause peopel to have depression, anger, and not have a source of income. AI also lack creativity, this is because AI is dependant on programmed algorithms. Finally, AI can be hard to implement, they can be very costly, lack of essentials for the AI, and the lack of people experienced to implement it.

One way I think technology impacts the election positively because it can speed up the voting process and one way I think it could face some challenges is not inputting the correct option that a voter chose, this has been a problem in the past with technology with elections.

1. It's important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online because it can reveal things you don't want to be known about you. 2. You can use strong, unique passwords. 3. No, I haven't, but I hvae shared some embarrassing things as a child and now I would think before I post anything. 4. I can balance being open and collaborative in online spaces by limiting the amount of personal information shared online.

(This is without bias and just using sources.) A current event is the presidential election. In the election, Donald Trump won. This can lead to problem solving of agenda management and either the rise or decline of certain things. Advancements in computer science could play a role in this by having computers predict how things are going to turn out and how to optimize agendas. They can predict how things are going to turn out by creating a data sheet a computer can go off of to make a preciction. Then they can optimize agendas by being given what is optimized and what's not, then creating a code to make anything optimized.

Project Proposal and Setup: My idea is to make a unit converter, being able to convert kg. to g., ft. to in., kilometers to miles, etc. Some key features would be conversion calculation, supported units and categories, a interface to select different units, error handling, and a clear button. Some python concepts I'll be using are variables, dictionaries, functions, lists, conditionals, and loops.

Technology makes food more accessable during the holiday season by using delivery apps. It makes it more accessable because people don't have to go out and take time to get food, instead they can wait at their home. Then, technology can decrease labor for farmers and produce more crops. Technology can have a downside because if anything goes wrong with it, it can slow down produce by a lot.

AI contributes to VR by making user interaction easier with things like commands and gesture recognition. They can also create more complex NPC's by making them have very complex behaviors. This excites me because it can cretae a whole new experience for VR gaming, making it more intresting and making replayability much more fun. This can change the entire playing field for my field of interest, since my field of interest is game development. Some ethical considerations that might need to be addressed is if the AI will stay appropriate with NPC dialogue and if commands for the AI will be read correctly. My source is ironically the google AI.

To me the term "brain rot" means somethign that is so stupid it'll rot your brain. I feel like social media doesn't affect my well-being because nothing online can affect how I am in real life. The word "slop" usually means something bad, for example, "My music is slop." Meanwhile the word "lore" is used to describe a backstory or details of somethign that happened.
# December 16, 2024
I am excited for winter break because I'll be able to get a break from the amount of work I'm getting and I'm going to gte to hang out with my friends.

1. What I enjoyed the most about this class is that I'm able to catch up on other classes work. 2. I'd like to start learning about the basics of making games if possible. 3. I am interested in pursuing a Unity certification because Unity is used to make games. I'd need to learn the basics of Unity and basics of making games so I'd feel prepared.
# January 13, 2025
I think that the shift to AI will help a lot. This is because of jobs like separating good apples from bad apples for example or sorting inventory. AI would be able to detect what a good apple is and toss out the bad ones. I'd prepare myself by having a backup plan because I'd know that I could be replaced.
# January 22, 2025
I think that the governments intervention impacts technology companies and users because now if companies are affiliated with China, they have to sell to the government because of security concerns. Then, users will lose access to their apps and become suppressed. TikTok could show how their security works and ensure that the users privacy is safe.
One feature I woulde implement is to have a password to history. A lesson I could take from this situation is making sure that the security of my users are safe. Then I wouldn't associate myself with suspicious companies.

 Technology can help to increase aviation safety by integrating more AI into the system. This can help by automating tedious tasks done by humans. They can also take care of data and do predictive analytics do help prevent problems for aviation.
 Then using both AI and humans can help prevent even more problems. AI can do most of the work while humans can check it. If there is anything wrong, they can change whatever it is and keep moving.

 Technology can be use to help educatiors and service providers stay updated because it can keep track of new slang. It can also make a graph of how popular it is and even what they mean. Some potential benefits is that apps can understand someone who is using this slang. On the other hand, the apps may get confused easier and misunderstand trying to see if someone is using slang.
 It is best for school to leave slang informal. The reason they should is because it would make education for children much harder on both teachers and children, introducing a whole new set of vocabulary that is not necessarily needed. Continuing off of that, misunderstanding would impact interactions because they can lead to cluelessness, sadness, or anger. An example is if someone thinks you're saying something mean to them, but in reality you're saying something completely different.

 Over the break, I mostly used technology like games, social media, and apps on my computer. Games entertained me because I got to play with my friends and do something I find fun. Then, apps and social media entertained me because I got to listen to music and got to be able to communicate with my friends.
 Games connect with what I'm learning in this class because I'm trying to learn to make games, and this class can help me achieve that. Apps connect with this class because in this class making apps can be a cool yet challenging project in this class. Finally, social media connects with this class because this class can teach us to execute demands from the computer, which social media requires all the time to send messages between one another.

 March Madness has integrated AI for game predictions and AAR for broadcasting, changing how fans engage. AI driven predictions help fans create better brackets, but perfect bracket attempts can take away the excitement of surprises. AR improves broadcasts, making games more immersive.
  Social media and streaming make the tournament more accessible and interactive. Fans can watch anywhere, discuss games instantly, and engage with highlights. However, traditional viewing loses its uniqueness as digital content dominates the experience.

1. I'm okay.
2. The most stressful thing for me lately is the amount of work I have in my classes and more so that my gf brokeup with me and shes already moved on.
3. Some things I do to take care of myself is to rest, talk to my friends, and play games with my friends.
4. One goal I have for the rest of the year is to have all 90s for my class avgs.
5. Someone I talk to when I'm feeling overwhelmed is my bestfriend, Leo. I trust them because I've known them for years and they've gone through similar experiences as I have.

 Tools like ChatGPT, Khanmingo, or other learning apps could help me with understanding certain concepts. The first example could be understanding how to get the tension of a rubberband in a physics problem. It would be able to give the steps on how to do it while giving a detailed explanation and finally giving me the answer.
 AI could help me study for tests by giving me questions and helping me understand why I got it wrong, if I got it wrong. The most useful feature would be the fact it could break things down, and give you a more detailed or simplified explanation to help you understand. I would use this, mainly because I already do use it to help me understand certain concepts with my work.

 I think these bans are detrimental to the students. The reason I believe this is because cyberbulling isn't that much of a big deal, because all you have to do is ignore them because they don't know how you're really like. This also would disable communication between students and their parents if anything important happens.
 These policies would make students outraged, and if anything like a lockdown happened, students wouldn't be abel to notify their parents. If this happened to our school, I would be incredibly mad, and I would advocate for the removal of this policy.

100 men would win against a gorilla. Based on the information given, the humans can gang up on the gorilla and the gorilla doesn't have infinite stamina. So this would mean that multiple people can take on the gorilla, confuse it, hinder its mobility, and eventually tire it out and win.
It's not responsible to make this challenge viral. Apparently, Mr. Beast is trying to organize this challenge for a Youtube video. This would be very irresponsible, dangerous, and would inspire others to do the same, when they would definitely wouldn't have safety percausions like Mr. Beast would have.

We should try to encourage people to actually take care of their chromebooks and not destroy them. We should know that there's consequences of this trend, and students should realize this. If students know this, they're more likely to not commit these acts. 
I would say that these people would have to pay for the damages. If they would have to pay up somehow, like going to juvie. So, I think this trend is very irresponsible and that students should realize this.

Option 1: My thoughts on this new school law is that it is completely useless and negative. In school, if kids want to learn they will do their best to do so, but if they don' even care about learning they'll go ahead and find something else to do. This shows that banning phones wont fix students attention, the students who don't find any interest in learning will find something else to do because they can't use their phones, they'll talk to other classmates, sleep, or play random games. Since the law prevents students from using their devices, they have no way to contact the outside world. This shows how the law is negative because if something bad would happen, students can't contact their family to let them know what is going on, the parents would only find out after the fact.
# September 8, 2025
The career I'm interested in is game development. Computer science is insanely important to game development because it's made completely out of computer science. To create a game, you need a computer with a game engine which was made by computer science and you can't make a digital game without it. We use math, programs, scripts, and sometimes AI to make up video games, which were all created from computer science. So, computer science is incredibly valuable to game development because computer science is the base to develop and create video games.

My idea for an AI project would be to go through chemical combinations to find cures to diseases. My idea meets the challenge requirements because its using AI to help health, safety, and the community. It also is a creative idea because its something that probably hasnt been done before. This use of AI would be useful because it would take time off for scientists trying to find cures so they can go do something else equally as important. This is helpful to people because it can lead to cures to cancer, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, etc.

I think working for a virtual store for real money is a horrible idea for the future of jobs. This will result in less people going out to search to work in retail in real life. The article doesn't seem to explain what the virtual workers actually contribute to real life. This will cause actual workers to just quit their actual job to go work for a virtual one for seemingly just playing games. In conclusion, working for a virtual store for real money is horrible for the future of jobs because it doesn't seem to actually contibute anything and there will be less people going into retail and people in retail might quit to go into virtual retail.

The phrase "6-7" is used all around schools. So many students mention it because it's a popular meme. This popular meme is of a teenager saying the phrase "6-7". He does this while flapping his hands pretending the numbers are in his hands. The teenager says this because the song "Doot Doot" by Skrilla is playing. It is in this song where the phrase "6-7" is said.

If I was in charge of my school, I'd allow web games but I'd block most of the other reasources. The reason for this is because I wouldn't want students to be using things like AI to cheat, but I think that the Google AI is fine because you can use it to help you learn something you're struggling with. The Google AI is pretty smart, but it usually isn't able to help you cheat because it gets more errors than ChatGPT or Gemini would. On the other hand, I'd allow things like phones and web games as long as you've atleast finished your work for your class, but if the teacher is lecturing or doesn't want phones in their classrom at all, the students should put away their phones until they're allowed to have it out again. So in conclusion, I'd allow students to be mostly free with their technology but I wouldn't allow them to be on things if they're being intructed, haven't finished their work, or if it's AI other than the Google AI.

My prompt was designed to create an interactive project that should teach students if else statements in Python. It's supposed to let students be able to click an answer choice and it should play a correct animation if they got the question correct, and an incorrect animation if they got it incorrect. In my personal opinion, Canva interpreted the prompt perfectly because it did what I asked of it and more. The interactive part that worked the best was the correct/incorrect animations. I could improve it by asking it to make more questions, varying difficulty, and have it show how many you got correct.
