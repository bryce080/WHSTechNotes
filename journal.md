In Python, I find while loops very interesting and useful. I think they're interesting because they're able to repeat the code you give it. I find them useful because they save me time of typing out more code.

I think you could've specified for us to make our journal public and emphasized that we only had to do one per week. I did not encounter any challenges while following instructions.
# September 17, 2024
This is a free week.

Following instructions exactly as given is important in coding because it can cause logic errors. If you dont follow intructions exactly as given, it can lead to your codes meaning something else entirely or it just not working in the first place. This shows how following intructions exactly as given is important because it can lead to logic errors which can lead to your code not working or meaning something else.

A process in which computer science plays a role in my daily activities are video games. Video games are literally made out of code which means without code, there would be no video games. Coding in video games are used to make assets, functions, graphics, and alot more. Without coding my life would be alot more boring because in my freetime I usually play video games.

A computer science career that inetrests me is being a gameplay engineer. Gameplay engineers work with game engines and programming software to drive the game along with Programmer teams. They also work with animation and computer graphics software and write code to ensure the game can be brought to life. Some languages that are required are C, C++, Java, Nuke, and Unreal Engine. You need at least a bachelor's degree to be qualified for being a gameplay engineer. Opportunities for growth are progressing to Gameplay Programmer, Tools Programmer, or Engine Programmer. It aligns with my interests and goal in CS because that's basically what I want to be, I want to create games and being a gameplay engineer is exactly that, making the idea into a reality. \n Colleges that provide education for this career are Southern Methodist University, University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Dallas, and Baylor University.
